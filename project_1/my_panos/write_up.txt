Our pano_stitcher.py has a main method that stitches together three images of the UT tower at night. You only need to type "python pano_stitcher.py" and it will create the panorama and label it as pano.png in my_panos


We attempted the  Panorama of a planar scene. It warps the images wrong because it can't find the homography matrix. In our pano_stitcher.py, in our main method we create the mosaic out of photos we took from different positions. if you run "python pano_stitcher.py" it will create the panorama as planar_pano.png

If you run "python pano_stitcher.py" it will generate both of those images.

To run our panorama program run `./mosaic image1 image2 image3` from this directory. The image will be output as panorama.png.
